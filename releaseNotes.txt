            - Added support for secret key
            - Second part of OT 31547. The connector initialize code will first check the configuration for a username and if it's not found there, it will look in SystemInfo for a serial number
            - Added an interceptor/validator pattern to allow business rules to be applied.  The only rule so far is to update net.server.hostname and net.server.state when net.cell.data.state changes.  It
               performs some simple validation (looks for non-empty hostname)
            - Changed the FAKE modem to use an IMSI with 999999 as the first chars.  This will trigger the selection of QAQUART as the desired server.  This should let things run automatically on the linux
              build server.
            - Created IMSI prefix 999999 to use a fake APN and the qaquart bridge as the IP for testing the "FAKE" modem on the build server.

            - Watchdog added signal handling and now sigkills children on exit by default.

    Bugs Fixed:
            - APN and Hostname are now always published in the next status update request.  This makes the "active" APN now visible, even if the data connection doesn't work
            - OnTIme 32087 - Fix bug where the port was invalid after closing a connection
